The first solo project during my study at General Assembly's Software Engineering immersive. 

# Developed by Sami Hakim 

# Deployment
Game is deployed and playable here 

# Concept 
This game is based ont the hugeley popular 80's arcade game Pac-Man. 

The aim of the game is for the player to eat all the food in an arena, while trying themselves to avoid being eaten by the four ghosts that are hunting them.
If the player eats special items then they can eat the ghosts for a limited time and send them back to their start location, and gain extra points in the process. 

The game ends when there is no more food or the player has run out of lives.
